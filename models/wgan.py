## Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty (GP)
The original [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) leverages
the Wasserstein distance to produce a value function that has better theoretical
properties than the value function used in the original GAN paper. WGAN requires that
the discriminator (aka the critic) lie within the space of 1-Lipschitz functions.
The authors proposed the idea of weight clipping to achieve this constraint. Though
weight clipping works, it can be a problematic way to enforce 1-Lipschitz constraint
and can cause undesirable behavior, e.g. a very deep WGAN discriminator (critic)
often fails to converge.
[WGAN-GP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf) proposed an alternative to weight
clipping to ensure smooth training. Instead of clipping the weights, the authors
proposed a "gradient penalty": adding a loss term that keeps the L2
norm of the discriminator gradients close to 1.
